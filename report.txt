- I used gemini cli to create a cricket live score web page using rss feed xml provided by crickinfo.
rss feed: https://static.cricinfo.com/rss/livescores.xml
- prompt that is used in this project was: I would like to create a Python Flask Application that shows me a list of live scores of cricket matches. There is a RSS Feed for this that is available over here: https://static.cricinfo.com/rss/livescores.xml. Let's use that.
- css/style added for better viewing experience
